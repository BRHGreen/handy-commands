Rename local and remote branches/remove

1. Rename your local branch.
If you are on the branch you want to rename:
git branch -m new-name
If you are on a different branch:
git branch -m old-name new-name

2. Delete the old-name remote branch and push the new-name local branch.
git push origin :old-name new-name

3. Reset the upstream branch for the new-name local branch.
Switch to the branch and then:
git push origin -u new-name

Add and commit with one command. It will only add changes to git tracked files though so any new files will need to be added with `git add .`
# make some changes
$ git commit -a -m "Changed something"
# make some more changes
$ git commit -a -m "Changed something else"

…then you can git push… whenevz

Checkout specific file(s)/dir(s): 
git checkout c5f567 -- file1/to/restore file2/to/restore

- list branches sorted by commit date: 
git branch --sort=-committerdate

- delete branch: 
git branch -d <branch_name>

…and there are unmerged changes which you are confident of deleting:
git branch -D <branch_name>
