create a new database (must end with a semicolon and must not contain hyphens): e.g.: create database test_1;
OR if you have postures running you do not need to be inside the sql shell. Navigate to `~` (I don’t know if this is actually necessary, and run `created <database name>`

create user with permissions: 
Hilary=# CREATE USER test_username_1 WITH PASSWORD 'test_password_1';
Hilary=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "test_graphql_db" to test_username_1;

connect to db: `\c <name of db>`

show all tables: `\d`

\list or \l: list all databases

\dt: list all tables in the current database

show the contents of a specific table: `\d <name of table>

show all of the content within a table:
select * from <name-of-section>; <—-remember the semicolon

Get data where fields match a particular parameter:
select * from <name-of-tabel where <name-of-parameter>=<what-parameter-is-equal-to>;
eg:
select * from people where id=11;

quit: \q
